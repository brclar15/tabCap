# Acknowledgements

This project comes out of and is complimentary to my undergraduate thesis, where I looked at the retellings of the Epic Cycle found on the Tabula Capitolina, as well as various other retellings. For the continued guidance, support, and inspiration, I am deeply indebted to Professor Neel Smith. 

The open access photography from which I created my edition was taken by Rebecca Finnigan and Nikolas Churik during their Spring 2014 study abroad term in Rome. Without their help and effort, I would not have been able to produce my own edition nor would I have been able to engage with the original artifact as much as I have. Additionally, Drew Virtue digitally altered a number of these photographs, in order to make the texts clearer. This greatly increased the usability of the images and even more greatly decreased my stress level during the transcription. 

For my XSLT transformation, I want to thank Alex May  who enthusiasicaly and patiently got me started on displaying my edition.
