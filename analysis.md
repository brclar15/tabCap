# Analysis of Retellings of the Tabula Capitolina compared to the *Iliad*

Here I walk through the retellings for each book on the stone and compare them to the *Iliad*. Keep in mind that not all books appear in both the visual and textual retellings, while others are completely absent from the stone all together, due to the damage that it has sustained. I have placed the general trends of my analysis at the end of this page, after the discussion of the individual books. 

## Book 1

The pictorial retelling of this book is both expansive and precise. The band of images for book 1 occupies the prominent position of the top edge of the stone. As a result, it is about twice as long as the bands for books 13 through 24 (as well as the length that books 2 through 24 would have been in the stone's original condition). The band appears to contain five episodes, more than any other band on the Tabula Capitolina. Not only are there more episodes, but they are more highly labeled than the other episodes. Instead of merely providing names, as is the common practice for the bands of books 13 through 24, book 1 contains much more complete ideas. The first episode is labeled "ιερον απόλλωνος ζμινθέως χρυσης", and the fourth is labeled "οδυσσευς την εκατoμβην τω θεω αγων απολλωνι χρυσηις". This type of description is unique to the labels found in these labels is unique and noteworthy. The amount of space and detail given to book 1 shows its clear importance. Rather than reorganize the stone and place a band for the events of the *Cypria* at the top and twelve Iliadic books on each side, the artist chose to highlight book 1. This decision and its importance must not be overlooked. 

Due to its length and detail, the visual retelling of book 1 matches book 1 of the *Iliad* very closely. In both, Chryses invokes Apollo's wrath against the Greeks, the god sends a plague upon them, the Greeks hold an assembly to discuss the matter, Odysseus brings Chryseis and sacrifices back to Apollo, and Thetis duplicates Zeus on her son's behalf. The tabula goes so far as to name every single Greek who speaks during the assembly in its labels. The figure of Athena restrains Achilles by the hair in both the visual retelling and the *Iliad*. The inclusion of this element of the episode shows its essential nature and importance, as well as the stone artist's precision. The fact that Odysseus is named as the one bringing the sacrifices to Apollo, as he is in the *Iliad*, shows both the artist's attention to detail and his knowledge of the *Iliad*. 

The episode where Thetis supplicates Zeus is a prime example of how highly compressed these episodes can be. The reader does not get the initial part of the episode, namely Achilles plea to Thetis, but rather the outcome. Besides these two figures and their posture, no more information is needed in order for the audience to be able to recognize this episode. The labels serve to identify the figures, and the audience's knowledge of the poem fills out the rest. The Tabula is a highly compressed retelling, and therefore cannot spell out the entire episode, but rather chooses evocative moments that call the wider episode to mind. 

It is important to note that the episode that begins *Iliad* 1 on the stone may have not been the initial episode in the stone's original state. It is plausible that an episode where Chryses asks Agamemnon for his daughter back opened the retelling for this book. While Petrain does not explicitly propose this hypothesis, he does suggest that there are episodes missing from the band dedicated to the *Aethiopis* (Petrain 198). By extension, that would mean that there was more to be found in the band for book 1 as well. It is difficult to assert confidently what would have been depicted on the stone in its complete form. Given the fact that the preface is missing its first three words, and that there would have needed to be space for the first inscribed stele, I believe that an additional scene would have been found for book 1. Working off of the *Iliad*, an episode involving Chryses at the Greek ships makes the most logical sense. 

## Book 7

The textual retelling on the Tabula merely mentions that the Greeks built a wall and a trench around the ships. In its extant condition, it completely skips over the duel between Hector and Ajax, as well as the Trojans' unsuccessful peace attempt. An explanation for this is that neither episode changes the outcome or precipitates any action in the *Iliad*. Hector and Ajax part ways in a tie, and the Greeks rebuff the Trojans attempt to sue for peace by returning the stolen property alone, but not Helen. The Tabula seems to concern itself with events that further the action of the poem, and not side action or conversations that do not impact the course of the narrative. 

Another explanation for their exclusion, similar to book 1, is that they were not, in fact, excluded. The textual retelling does not mark Iliadic books in any way. Therefore, one does know where one book starts and the next ends expect for the narrative context. It is possible that at least the duel between Hector and Ajax, which takes up the bulk of book 7, was found at the end of the first stele, which is now lost. It is dangerous to assume that the extant stele must reflect the beginning of book 7. It is entirely possible, given my explanation above, but by no means conclusive. 


## Book 8

In book 8, the battle between the Greeks and Trojans rages hard. The textual retelling reflects the *Iliad* when it stresses that the Trojans camped in front of the ships. This fact precipitates the next several books of the poem because it breaks the series of lighter skirmishes that had characterized the first nine years of the Trojan War. The fact that this added element of the otherwise unremarkable fighting underscores a pattern that will be seen throughout the rest of the analysis: that the Tabula stresses actions that lead to other key moments in the narrative. 

The stone does not, however, include the actions of the gods. In *Iliad* 8, Zeus rebukes Hera and Athena, and then proceeds to strengthen the Trojans. Excluding Thetis' supplication of Zeus in book 1, the tabula does not show the actions of the gods in heaven. They are occasionally seen on the battlefield, as will be seen later, but never in assembly or dialogue amongst themselves. All of the action depicted on the stone takes place at Troy, without exception. The scene jumps found in the *Iliad* serve to augment its narrative, but do not prove essential enough for this retelling. The hand of the gods in the Trojan war is undeniable, but they do not appear repeatedly as Zeus grants and removes their permission to intervene. Instead, their presence is largely limited to direct actions that they take on the battlefield. 

## Book 9

Comparing the textual retelling to the *Iliad* shows the importance of dividing episodes properly. One may be tempted to take the embassy to Achilles as one episode that encompasses the entirely of book 9. However, both the textual retelling and the poem itself suggest that it should be broken up into two episodes. First, as the text of the stele tells us, the Greeks discussed and arranged to send the embassy to Achilles. While the speech of Agamemnon is not preserved in the retelling, the idea behind it and the ensuing discussion causes the planning phase to be separated from the embassy itself. The details given by the stele, that Agamemnon plans to send back Briseis and gifts, show how this episode is distinct and elaborate. The actual embassy itself comes after, and is mentioned to be unsuccessful in both versions. Odysseus, Phoenix, and Ajax are essential figures in this episode, as they are mentioned explicitly where this scene appears. 

## Book 10

In contrast to book 9, the night raid is one episode, where the planning portion is merely an extra element. It is not given significant enough treatment in the *Iliad* nor in the textual retelling to merit its own episode. Much like the embassy to Achilles, the night raid has certain essential elements. The death of Dolon and Rhesus cannot be left out of this episode. This is seen through their expanded nature in the textual retelling. While Rhesus is only mentioned as "the Thracian" on the stele, and his true significance is famously not given in the *Iliad*, his importance to the course of the war would have been familiar to a tradition audience. There was a prophecy, as seen in other sources, that Troy would not be able to fall if Rhesus' horses drank from the river. While unnamed, this is the cause for Odysseus and Diomedes' seemingly unheroic slaughter of the Thracian king in his sleep. Obviously a length backstory like this would not figure in the textual retelling of the Tabula. 

## Book 11

Again, these both correspond exactly, with the chiefs falling in the same order too. 

## Book 12

Exactly the same, Hector breaks the walls. Only focuses on final action and outcome, not build up and side fighting or plans. 

## Book 13

textual retelling brief, just fighting. Iliad has a lot of fighting, images breaks it out into. The images, as is necessary, shows the battles. but why those? get because of Cassandra connection. but why not death of Alcathous?)

## Book 14

textual retelling brief, just fighting. Notably neither tabCap show Hera and Zeus episode, don't show things in heaven. Images show initial fight, Ajax and Poseidon makes sense and are prominent, but no Hector and Apollo mentioned in Iliad. 

## Book 15

textual retelling brief, just fighting. Images show prominent Trojans not emphasized in the Iliad. Aiantes prominent in images and Iliad. Only Iliad mentions gods 

## Book 16

all show the arming of Patroclus, Poenix and Diomedes are shown in the images but not present in the texts. All show him slaying enemies, but his death is not shown. perhaps it is too similar to the scene that beings book 17


## Book 17

Pretty similar overall, no labels on the tabula, no names mentioned in the textual retelling, but there's not a link there. Elaborated in the images, not sure why. not much change over who is defending the body. Mention Antiochus being sent in both text, sets up next book

## Book 18

Textual retelling just mentions the arms, and the Greeks brining the body home, in that order. The Iliad reverses the order, **with the body coming first** [look into this, apparently its in 19?] and then the arms. The Iliad has Achilles routing the Trojans from the walls by yelling, not sure how essential this is. We see the grieving for Patroclus in the images and the Iliad. Notably the Cyclopes in the images


## Book 19

Reconciliation mentioned in texts, not in images, where Achilles just arms and goes off to fight. textual retelling has him jump to 21, in the Scamander

## Book 20

*No textual retelling*
Poseidon and the gods join in both, essential, not well labels in images, just more fighting in Iliad


## Book 21

Textual retelling has Achilles killing Asteropaeus (due to his connection to the god). Images show him killing one figure, could stand for both? no label with him. Battle with Scamander, Poseidon is show in images, *look at role in Iliad*, textual retelling says that he "escapes the dangers of the river", vague and wishy washy on the gods, does not have him pushing to the gates, which sets up the next book, as the other two do. 


## Book 22

The death of Hector is highly standard throughout the retellings. The images specifically show them around the gates of Troy, while the textual retelling does not. The taking of the arms is not specifically shown in the images, but the fact that the body is nude while its being dragged, shows that it happened


## Book 23

All agree on the funeral of Patroclus and the funeral games


## Book 24

Ransom of Hector is similar in all, expanded in images, Hermes mentioned in Iliad and images, not in text, text is elaborate at the end about his burial
