# Editorial Practices

I have created a diplomatic digital edition of the Tabula Capitolina by working with digital open-access photography. A diplomatic edition is one that seeks to represent faithfully every mark that appears on a artifact, in order to provide an authentic reading of a object. Modern corrections and rules of orthography are not imposed onto the text, thus preserving its integrity and original from. For example, I have edited the text groups found on the Tabula completely in lower case and without proper accentuation. My only additions are found in the TEI "supplied" elements. These additions are meant to make my editions readable, and are taken from printed editions of the Tabula, such as the Inscriptiones Graecae volume 14 and *Homer in Stone*.
