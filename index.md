## Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold the *Iliad*, or broken it down into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is on the [Tabula Capitolina](http://shot.holycross.edu/eikon/tabulaeiliacae/Capitoline_1.jpg), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. There are two such retellings found on the stone: one visual in carved figures, and one textual in a prose summary. Since the stone has been partially damaged (see Introduction), I was unable to analyze the way that the entire *Iliad* is retold, but rather only the sections that survive on the stone. I have compared the retellings on the Tabula Capitolina, along with the retelling found in [Apollodorus' *Library*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D4), to the text of the [*Iliad*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0134). 

In order to study this document, I have created a [diplomatic digital edition](digitalEditing.md) of the text found on the stone. 

I owe a great deal of [thanks](thanks.md) to several people for help with various aspects of this project.
