##Aim of the project

The goal of this project is to analyze the way an ancient audience would have retold the *Iliad*, or broken it down into smaller episodes. Primarily, the focus of this work is on the [Tabula Capitolina](http://shot.holycross.edu/eikon/tabulaeiliacae/Capitoline_1.jpg), and the ways in which it retells the *Iliad*. There are two such retellings found on the stone: one visual in carved figures, and one textual in a prose summary. However, the stone has been damaged, and the visiual retelling for books 2 through 12, and the textual retelling for books 1 through 6 do not survive. 

In order to study this document, I have created a [diplomatic digital edition](digitalEditing.md) of the text found on the stone.
