# Moving Foward

## Ideas on how to expand this project

### Presentation
- figure out how to link edition html file directly
- Oranize website with home button and side bar for better navigation 
- add images into the various text pages

### Content 
- do more sophisticated transforms on the editon
  - generate various editions (with all editorial additions, just whats on the stone, etc
- dig deeper into retellings of the "battle books"
  - analyze significance of figures mentioned on the stone for those books
- add image citations for visual retellings
- add rough line ranges for Iliad passages
  - calculate relative sizes within work and within book, *maybe*?
  
### Broader Expansion   
- look at an analyze other Iliadic retellings
  - metrical summaries in VA
- add Epic Cycle portion of the Tabula Capitolina to this site, *maybe*?
