# Moving Foward

## Ideas on how to expand this project

- add image citations for visual retellings
- add rough line ranges for Iliad passages
  - calculate relative sizes within work and within book, maybe?
- figure out how to link edition html file directly
  - do more sophisticated transforms on the editon
  - generate various editions (with all editorial additions, just whats on the stone, etc
